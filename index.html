            <p>While small villages like Aburi in Ghana's Eastern Region sit just two hours from Accra, the world is increasingly defined by massive urban centers. Today, more than thirty megacities—each home to over 10 million people—dominate the global landscape. These metropolitan giants, each housing more residents than thousands of villages like Aburi combined, are expected to grow to fifty by 2050. CNRS researchers are studying this dramatic urbanization trend and how it's transforming human society and lifestyles.</p>

            <p>Is the city the future of humankind? Over the last fifty years, the urbanization of the planet has markedly accelerated and the number of city-dwellers now officially exceeds half of the world’s population. At the same time, a new kind of city has emerged: the megacity, an urban behemoth with 10 million people… or more. While Paris and London near 12 million souls, a conurbation like Shanghai is now approaching 80 million, thereby becoming—according to some geographers—the most populous city in the world, ahead of Tokyo. Although researchers do not agree on the order of the ranking, the world’s ten largest cities, which are home to dozens of million people, includes Shanghai, Guangzhou (Canton), Tokyo, Delhi, Mumbai (Bombay), New York with its 25 million inhabitants, as well as Rio and São Paulo in Brazil.</p>

            Size is not a problem
        </h3>
        <p>
            “Urbanization is so intense that it has clouded the issue,” says Michel Lussault, a geographer at the Environment, City, Society1 laboratory. “We no longer know where places like Mexico City, Tokyo, or Shanghai—which bear no resemblance to what they used to be—begin and end…” Not to mention the fact that some countries overestimate or deliberately underestimate their size, whether for geopolitical reasons or to obtain international aid. In theory, the city is defined by the continuity of the built environment—the general consensus being that there should be a maximum of 200 meters between two buildings. Yet administrative divisions and the official statistics provided by countries follow an entirely different logic… Administratively speaking, for example, Paris is confined to the area situated inside the city’s périphérique ringroad, and is home to only 2 million inhabitants.

        <p>
            Yet growing inequalities are far from being the only challenge posed by this change in scale. The transport flows and pollution generated by daily traffic congestion has become the main concern of these huge urban clusters—in cities like Beijing, Shanghai, or Mexico City, emissions are such that the sky is now constantly a milky white color. Climate change is another major challenge, and a particularly important one for megacities due to the "heat island" phenomenon. “The mineral heart of cities is much hotter than their outskirts, and that looks set to worsen as the planet continues to warm," explains Lussault. "A city like Paris, for example, is 2°C warmer on average than its suburbs, but this differential can reach 5°C in a heat wave.”

                    Although the problems they face are commensurate with their size, megacities are also seeking to become places where solutions are found. A diplomatic system involving the planet's largest cities is now emerging, bypassing traditional discussions at the transnational level. On the issues of climate change and ecology, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, initiated in 2007 by the then mayor of London Ken Livingstone, brings together the 90 largest megacities in the world. The elected representatives of this network, which is currently chaired by the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, convene several times a year to look at issues including transport, food, motorways, migrations, etc. After the COP21 in Paris in late 2015, the C40 cities made a firm commitment to go beyond the emission thresholds to which countries had signed up. “Megacities claim that they can do better than the states they are part of, because they are not tied by diplomatic constraints,” notes Lussault.

                With megacities, a new geopolitical order is emerging. Increasingly interdependent—their ways of life tend to converge and their inhabitants to migrate from one to another—these city-worlds are real hubs of stability, partially escaping the diplomatic tensions that exist between countries. “This is undeniably a driving force for peace. But there is a serious risk that they could become completely cut off from the rest of the country,” Lussault warns. And that Paris for example might interact more with London, Frankfurt, or New York than with other French cities like Lille or Tours…
